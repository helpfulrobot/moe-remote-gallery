## Synopsis

Gallery designed for images to be hosted elsewhere (Amazon S3, Dropbox etc) rather than on the web server. 
 
This is another random edge-case use that I don't expect other people to have much use for. 

## Features
* Automatically create local thumbnails for fast page loading
* Filter images based on tags
* Lightbox full sized images from remote sources
* Basic taxonomy filter/logic built in

## Installation

### Composer
Ideally composer will be used to install this module. 
```composer require "moe/login-screen:@stable"```

## Screen shots

@TODO

## Libraries used
* Fancybox v2
* Mixitup
